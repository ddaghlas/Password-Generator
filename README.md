# Password-Generator
I was tasked with creating a password generator that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. The app is run in the browser that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I've written. The code is meant to be clean and polished with a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. The password can also include special characters. 

To satisfy all of the required client criteria:

- The password generator includes a button that when clicked, presents the employee with a series of prompts for password criteria.

- When the employee is prompted for password criteria, then they are able to select which criteria to include in the password.

- When the employee is prompted for the length, the length must be at least 8 characters long and no more than 128 characters.

- When the employee is prompted for character types to include, they are able to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

- When the employee answers each prompt, the input is then validated and at least one character type is selected.

- Once the employee answers all of the prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

- When the password is generated, it is displayed in an alert.
