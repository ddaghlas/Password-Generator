# Description
I was tasked with creating a password generator that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. The data the employee has access to is sensitive so the password must be strong and provide greater security. The app is run in the browser that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I've written. The code is meant to be clean and polished with a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. The password can also include special characters. 

To satisfy all of the required client criteria:

- The password generator includes a "Generate a Password" button that when clicked, presents the employee with a series of prompts for password criteria.

- When the employee is prompted for the length, the window alert displays that it must be at least 8 characters long and no more than 128 characters. The employee then chooses a numerical length (between 8 and 128) that they would like their password to be.

- If the password criteria is not met, the employee will be prompted with an alert window, stating that the criteria has not been met. 

- When the employee is prompted for password criteria, then they are able to select which criteria to include in the password by clicking OK for yes and CANCEL for no.

- When the employee is prompted for character types to include, they are able to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

- When the employee answers each prompt, the input is then validated and at least one character type is selected.

- Once the employee answers all of the prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

- When the password is generated, it is displayed in the text box.
